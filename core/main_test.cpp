###What is FFF?
FFF  is a decentralized blockchain based on IPFS/RIPPLE, which integrates lua virtual machine-based smart contracts. It is also a software platform designed to help coordinate voluntary free market operations amongst a set of social actors.

Replicas of the state machine are kept consistent using the Result Delegated Pows distributed consensus protocol.

FFF is making efforts to build up a high-performance decentralized enterprise blockchain platform to develop business blockchain applications, to eliminate cognitive fear of enterprises facing blockchain technology or corresponding applications, and to make the blockchain visualized and configurable.
